# Socket-Programing-using-Python
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.To use python socket connection, we need to import socket module. Then, sequentially we need to perform some task to establish connection between server and client. We can obtain host address by using socket. gethostname() function.
